Selenium Automation Framework
An Automation Framework is collection of assumptions,concepts and practices you bring in while developing the automation project, so it helps in constituting a work platform or support for automated testing.It would be great, if the framework is application independent.

If you look into the any existing framework,it will be block of function libraries for reporting , error handling , and driver scripts.So the test automation framework is an execution environment for automated tests. It is the overall system in which our tests will be automated.



Purpose:
-- To build a Hybrid Test Automation Framework which can be used across different web based applications. In this approach, the endeavor is to build a lot of applications independent reusable keyword components so that they can directly used for another web application without spending any extra effort. With this framework in place, whenever we need to automate a web based application, we would not need to start from scratch, but use the application independent keyword components to the extent possible and create application specific components for the specific needs.
